===Elastic Maze===

Solution to the the [elastic path developer challenge] (http://www.epdeveloperchallenge.com/) which should probably be done in Java rather than PHP but hey.

Also, line 117 of Cell.php is a pretty serious kluge - there's a more efficient way to solve it than to keep randomly guessing. But hey.

Also, Superman >>> Green Lantern. Fact!

====Build====

##
1. `git clone https://github.com/ptraverse/elastic-maze-php.git`
2. `php composer.phar install`
3. `php solve.php`
